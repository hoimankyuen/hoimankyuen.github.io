        "Budget Shop Simulator is an simulation arcade game about working a budget shop till as long as you can in a time limit. It's further complicated by faulty equipments which the player needs to react to, reduced merchandises that require special attention, and occasionally petty customers that the player needs to keep an eye out for. Gameplay was designed to be as chaotic yet fun as possible, with a comically dark cooperate theme to it.",
        "The game is a game jam project developed in around 7 days using Unity mostly by myself, with a separate member handling music and sound effects. The game was ranked 52 out of 2172 entries from the same game jam."
