        "Alkimia Shadowing is a first person puzzle game about following the footsteps of a alchemist master. The game challenges the player to figure out the correct steps of creating a potion, by observing the memories made from shadow. The game was inspired by The Room and Return of the Obra Dinn for that cryptic tone and the innovative puzzle design.",
        "The game is a game jam project developed in around 7 days using Unity mostly by myself. It was well received by the judges, noted especially with the clever use and interpretation of the shadow theme."
