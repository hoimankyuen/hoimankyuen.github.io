        "Super Marketcart Grocery Dash Deluxe is a driving / racing game about driving a trolley in a supermarket collecting the required groceries before the time runs out. The game is physics-based where the trolley can easily lose balance and roll over if not careful. There are currently three levels with progressively increasing difficultly. The game also features special collectables for each levels that make the game replayable.",
        "The game is a game jam project developed in around 10 days using Unity by a team of three. The game was ranked 7 out of 95 entries from the same game jam."
