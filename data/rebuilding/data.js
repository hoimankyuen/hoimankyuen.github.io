        "Rebuilding the Lost Dimension is a two-player co-op puzzle game. Set in the day before the demolition of the Walled City of Kowloon, both players were tasked to record the last moment of the city before it was destroyed. Both players play in a vastly different way, where one player is walking within the maze-like walled city finding objectives, and the other player looks at the map separately waiting for the first player to report objective locations. Both players must communicate and work together to succeed in the task within the time limit.",
        "The game is a school project developed using Unity. It was hugely inspired by Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes in a way that both players cannot see what the other player can see, and they require information from the other player to complete the task at hand. The game also utilized mobile VR using Google cardboard, which provides the player in the walled city with a true sense of immersion."
