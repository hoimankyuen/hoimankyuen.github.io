        "Remote Stranding is a top-down space shooter about defeating enemies and gathering resources in order to build a signal tower. The game also contains a latency gimmick that all inputs contains a lag, and that increase the further you travel away from the home base. The player would be more likely to encounter harder enemies, special regions and more loot when getting further away. Upgrades are also available but that would requires the same resources that can otherwise be used to build the tower.",
        "The game is a game jam project developed in around 16 days using Unity mostly by myself, with a separate member handling music and sound effects. The game manged to win the game jam, while also getting 1st on both theming and marketing. Gameplay average duration is around 3 hours, which is rare for a jam game."
