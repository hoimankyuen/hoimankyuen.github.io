                        <p>From the day I learned Unity around ten years ago, I have been continuously working on a number of different games and projects, whether it be self-projects, school projects, or projects at work. Every time I contributed to the projects to the best of my abilities to make them as good and polished as possible. Here I proudly present a selection of the projects that I am personally fond of, and I will explain in detail what I have done and achieved during the development process.</p>

                            <p>Club Grenade is a fast-paced multiplayer lite action game about defeating enemies with grenades and throwables only. The players must cooperate and fight through waves of enemies through the level, or be defeated by the enemy when within chaotic friendly fire. The game was inspired by Overcooked and its chaotic yet fun gameplay.</p>
                            <p>The game was a school project developed using Unity by a small team of 3 people that I led. The project was the winner of the Best Project Award and the Dean's Fund Award among all other projects from the engineering department. </p>

                            <p>Dicing Heros is a turn-based strategy game about fantasy battles, with the twist that both dice and pieces exist in the same physical space. It is inspired by how the dice thrown in a board game may accidentally interact with other pieces on the board. The game puts the player in command of a team of different units with different stats and abilities, along with a few dice. Dice can be used to further enhance unit stats, and is key to defeat the enemy team.</p>
                            <p>This game is developed using Unity, and is an experiment to explore the concept of a gridless chess-like strategy game. Physics introduce cases where pieces may be pushed off the grid by thrown dice, adding another layer of variables and complexity to the game. </p>

The game borrows traditional rhythm game elements such as notes and timing lines, with the feel of flying through a space tunnel when playing. The flying effect is achieved by twisting the note path and turning the screen in response to the player input.</p>

                            <p>Rebuilding the Lost Dimension is a two-player co-op puzzle game. Set in the day before the demolition of the Walled City of Kowloon, both players were tasked to record the last moment of the city before it was destroyed. Both players play in a vastly different way, where one player is walking within the maze-like walled city finding objectives, and the other player looks at the map separately waiting for the first player to report objective locations. Both players must communicate and work together to succeed in the task within the time limit.</p>
                            <p>The game is a school project developed using Unity. It was hugely inspired by Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes in a way that both players cannot see what the other player can see, and they require information from the other player to complete the task at hand. The game also utilized mobile VR using Google cardboard, which provides the player in the walled city with a true sense of immersion.  </p>
