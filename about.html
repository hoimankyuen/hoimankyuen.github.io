                    <p>I am a software developer specialising in Unity3D and C# in creating games and interactive content, with more than four years of working experience and much more on my own personal projects. My primary skillsets are programming and software development, but being in a startup-esque environment during most of my career, I also did 3D modelling, graphic design, UI/UX, shader programming, gameplay design etc. from time to time. (I also built this webpage from scratch)</p>
                    <p>In work I do well both as an individual and as a team member, contributing my experience to ensure the success of the task at hand. I take pride in being attentive to details, having great problem-solving skills, being eager to learn new things should the need arise, and  most important of all, being helpful and kind to every people I worked with.</p>
                    <p>I am very passionate about games and game development, even from a very young age. I used to create board games and card games when I was six, and I later created my first video game using Game Maker (version 5.0 at the time) even before I learned programming. This passion eventually drove me into a Computer Game Development program and a Computer Science degree where I acquired all the skills needed for game development. I also frequently learn different aspects of video game design in my spare time, and I have great respect for those who can create such wonderful experiences.</p>
